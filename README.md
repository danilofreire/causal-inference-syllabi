# Causal Inference Syllabi

A syllabi repository for courses on experimental design and causal inference. [Dean Eckles](https://twitter.com/deaneckles/status/909468516423802881) compiled the materials. I'm sharing them here just because I wanted to have a copy of the repository and had no reason to keep it private :)
